    <h1>Drumbeat Code Test</h1>

    <p>This is a codetest intended to test core front end development</p>
    <p>The goal is to take the following figma design and to recreate it in a responsive example</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/k2HH1ZPP8uiJKnmoF6fJ3M/FE-codetest?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">https://www.figma.com/file/k2HH1ZPP8uiJKnmoF6fJ3M/FE-codetest?node-id=0%3A1</a></p>
    <p>The API with corresponsing data is available here <code>https://codetest.drumbeat-server.co.uk/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?_embed&per_page=100</code> this is open CORS so is greenlit for ajax / fetch / axios to use. Please use this api, any missing data such as cetegory etc from the API feel free to use palceholder text</p>
    <p>The reduced build script to setup a local development environment is in included and setup instructions are located in the readme.md</p>
    <p>Please take no longer than an hour to complete this after setting up the node / gulp build tools, we're looking for code quality not code completion, we would much rather see well executed incomplete code alongside a note of next steps at the end of the hour</p>
    <p>We are happy to recieve a fork of this repository or a zip file of the completed code test.</p>
